## Description

_Duration: 10 Hours_

This application is designed for an employer to determine their monthly payroll for all of their employees.  The application takes some basic employee inputs, adds them to a table, and calculates the total monthly payroll.  If you want to remove an employee, a delete button allows you to delete said employee from the payroll.
